# Fashion Image Generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) with TensorFlow

This project implements a **Generative Adversarial Neural Network (GAN)** for generating fashion images using the **Fashion MNIST dataset**. The GAN architecture consists of a generator and a discriminator trained to create and classify synthetic fashion images, respectively.

## Project Structure

- **Generator**: A neural network that transforms random noise into realistic fashion images.
- **Discriminator**: A neural network that distinguishes between real images (from the dataset) and fake images (from the generator).
- **Custom Training Loop**: The GAN is trained using a custom loop where both networks are trained simultaneously to improve their performance.

## Features

- **Fashion MNIST Dataset**: The dataset contains 28x28 grayscale images representing different fashion items (e.g., shirts, shoes, bags).
- **TensorFlow and Keras**: TensorFlow and Keras are used to build the generator and discriminator models, as well as the training loop.
- **Multi-GPU Scaling**: The project is optimized for multi-GPU setups for faster and more efficient training.
- **Data Pipeline**: The data is processed using TensorFlow's Dataset API, with optimized pipelines for batching, shuffling, and prefetching.
- **Model Visualization**: During training, images generated by the GAN are visualized using Matplotlib.

## Dependencies
